description: Prevention of AIDS program was implemented in Pogradec region. The geographic position of Pogradec region in the border with Macedonia and Greece and the high emigration and movement of population make evident the risk of AIDS. There is not enough information in the public for the ways of the transmission and the risk of AIDS. Based on the traditional culture there is shame to talk about sex, AIDS and issues related. The Albanian school and society was not prepared for such phenomena as Albanian got open. The education in the school and by the school is seriously questioned. More students are getting drugs, using alcohol and smoking even in the school properties. The educative potential of the Albanian family today (which varies much from town to village according to the level of education, tradition, etc.) is apparently diminishing. The local and national media (especially TV) are mainly playing a negative role in youth education. This program targeted the young people, specially the so-called “bad pupils” providing the needed information in AIDS prevention.
