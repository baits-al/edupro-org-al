description: This is a project aiming to influence the decision makers, those who make the policy for education in the country  and also to lobby in the teachers , students and community level preparing them to use their rights to influence in the decision making process. Being present in Tirana has made possible that Edu-Pro can be part of the national conferences and around tables, expressing its opinion and sharing experience. The specialists of our organization have been part of the working groups in defining the content standards in different school subjects being authors of the materials prepared. A very good relationship with the highest education institutions representatives is established and formal and informal meetings have been organised, trying to bring together the education specialists and the decision makers. Lobby has also served in using the experience gained from the pilot projects implemented in Pogradec, in effecting the national policies in education.
