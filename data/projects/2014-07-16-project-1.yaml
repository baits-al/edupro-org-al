description: Unique in its kind, this centre has had a large activity with the children and the youth of Pogradec. It has organized regional and national activities playing an important role in the education of youth and in filling their free time with teaching, educational, cultural and artistic activities, moving them off the streets, the gambling games and other actions with negative effects in their lives. The Organization aimed to create a Centre with a sustainable structure that would continue to benefit the children and the youth.  After the end of this period the Centre was handed over successfully to the Government and it continues to run for the same purpose in very good conditions and having the same activities.
