description: This project is still in process of implementation. It aims to establish the counselling service in school, as a service which is missing while the need is obvious. The preparation of the counselling offices in the biggest schools in the city, the training of the councillors, involving the school structures and the community in the process, have been the results reached during the implementation process. As the project is coming to its end, the government has made the decision for establishing the counselling service in the main schools of the city. The experience gained will go on in each school included in the project and the government will financially support the process.
